# Rick and Morty Web Application


### Phase 1 Javascript Project Idea

This web application was created to allow users to scroll through many characters from the television show `"Rick and Morty"` using the public [**API**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). 



### Application Features

* Users can scroll through a page of characters
* Users can click a `More about me!` button on each character to populate more information
* Users can `filter` characters by criteria such as `gender` and `species`



## Using the Application

* Character **cards** appear upon navigating to the page
